# ProceduralTrees
Procedural trees generated from a silhouette mesh

Usage instructions:
- Rename an individual mesh as "mesh" to be used as the silhouette for the tree
- Place and scale the mesh considering that the root of the tree will be at the origin
- Copy the code in a Maya Python script editor window
- Hit play in the script editor
- Wait for the program to complete
- The resulting curves and geometry should appear under a group called "tree" at root level
